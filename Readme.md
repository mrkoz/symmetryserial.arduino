## Symmetry Serial Arduino
Version 1.2

## Synopsis

Symmetry serial is a basic communication structure that allows simple bi-direction communication and a bunch of useful helper methods to make it simpler. THe communication is as lightweight as possible to keep things a bit quick and makes use of only basic maths functions for error checking.

## Usage

**The examples are not done**

## Motivation

Most tutorials around the place allow for very basic communication using strings for simple structures, this library allows for relatively complex communication.

Main goals:

* multiple command types
   * status command - short command that can be decided on
   * variable length data packet
* detect and drop errors
* basic disconnection detection
